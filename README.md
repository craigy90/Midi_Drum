Midi Drum

Drum has piezo sensors guled beneath skin. Signal is fed to Pi Pico analog inputs.

Current:
Three piezo sensors calibrated
There is alway cross talk between sensors. Physical design limitation. Make the 3 sounds similar like 3 bongo sounds,
as if it is one drum with 3 tones

Due to some sound packs in Ableton being only limited input - now trying
to have a program drum sounds sequence at start up.

Using sensors to adjust setup value

Changed calibration method
